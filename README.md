# IDEA Engine #
IDEA is an artificially intelligent program which operates as a virtual assistant for a variety of different functions 
and tasks. The engine is developed using [Java SE 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) and utilizes 
[PostgreSQL 12](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/index.html) for its database management system.

## Installation ##
If you are interested in contributing to the development of this project, you must install the IDEA Engine locally. To
do so, it is _recommended_ to use JetBrain's [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) integrated development
environment although you are free to use any other IDE (or lack thereof) of your choosing. The following steps assume
that you are using the aforementioned IDE.

### Cloning the repository and setting up directory structure... ###
